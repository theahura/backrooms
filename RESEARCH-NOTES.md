# Research Notes

## Project Overview
Backrooms is a survival horror top-down 2D twin-stick shooter built with web technologies (HTML, JS, CSS). Inspired by the Backrooms creepypasta and the Flash game Motherload.

## Key Requirements
- Top-down 2D view with camera centered on player
- Pitch black rooms illuminated only by player's flashlight
- Twin-stick controls: WASD movement, mouse aiming, left-click shoot, right-click use items, Q/E switch weapons
- Room-based level structure with connections (doors, stairs)
- Day cycle: enter backrooms, explore, collect valuables, return before battery dies
- Shop system for upgrades between runs
- Enemy AI: zombies that chase when player is visible, wander when not

## Technology Decisions

### Game Engine: Phaser 3 (~3.90.x)
- Most mature web-based 2D game framework
- Built-in: physics (Arcade), input handling, camera system, scene management, tilemaps
- Phaser 4 (v4.0.0, released April 2026) exists but is only 2 months old with limited ecosystem maturity
- Phaser 4's mask API has changed (BitmapMask → Mask filter) with incomplete documentation — risky for the flashlight system which is core to this game
- Decision: Phaser 3 for stability, migrate later if needed

### Bundler: Vite
- Official Phaser template uses Vite
- Fast HMR, simple config, ES module native

### Language: Plain JavaScript
- Spec says "html, js, css" — YAGNI on TypeScript

### Flashlight/Visibility System: RenderTexture + BitmapMask
- Two-layer approach: dark cover overlay on top, game scene below
- RenderTexture serves as mask — draw flashlight cone shape into it each frame
- For wall occlusion: 2D raycasting visibility polygon algorithm
  - Cast rays toward wall segment endpoints + offset rays at ±0.00001 radians
  - Sort hits by angle, connect to form visibility polygon
  - Intersect with flashlight cone (two bounding angles from mouse direction)
- References: Ncase "Sight & Light" tutorial, Red Blob Games 2D Visibility
- Canvas `destination-out` compositing as alternative if Phaser masking is insufficient

### Performance Notes
- Only cast rays toward segment endpoints (O(N log N) from angle sort)
- Pre-bake radial gradient sprite instead of createRadialGradient each frame
- Half-resolution light mask if needed
- Single flashlight should have no performance issues

```

### Key Code Patterns
- Use `pointer.worldX`/`worldY` (not `pointer.x`/`pointer.y`) when camera follows player
- `startFollow(target, roundPixels, lerpX, lerpY)` — lerp of 0.1 for smooth camera
- Normalize velocity to prevent faster diagonal movement
- No gravity needed for top-down (gravity: { x: 0, y: 0 })
